## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

I learnt how the flex box works but I noticed my site is not still responsive. This is because I am still yet to learn responsive design and how to fit sites to different screens.


### Continued development

I need to place more focu on making my site more responsive and interactive. Also need to know how to fit images to different screens.
